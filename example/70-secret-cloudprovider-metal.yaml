  # If you use your own domain (not the default domain of your landscape) then you have to add additional keys to this secret.
  # The reason is that the DNS management is not part of the Gardener core code base but externalized, hence, it might use other
  # key names than Gardener itself.
  # The actual values here depend on the DNS extension that is installed to your landscape.
  # For example, check out https://github.com/gardener/external-dns-management and find a lot of example secret manifests here:
