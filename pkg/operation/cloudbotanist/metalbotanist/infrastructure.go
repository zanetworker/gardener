// DeployBackupInfrastructure kicks off a Terraform job which deploys the infrastructure resources for backup.
// It sets up the User and the Bucket to store the backups. Allocate permission to the User to access the bucket.
// As of this writing, Metal does not have an object store of its own. In the future, it may have one, and thus
// this will start to use it.
// Conversely, Gardener is working towards supporting object stores in a different provider than the one whose infra
// is being deployed. Once that is in, this woudl (optionally) run backups to AWS S3, Google Cloud, etc.
